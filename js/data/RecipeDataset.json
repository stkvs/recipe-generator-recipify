Using a large bowl and electric hand whisk, or a stand-alone mixer, cream together the butter and sugar until pale, light and fluffy. Spoon in the golden syrup, then add the beaten egg in 4 additions, whisking well after each and adding 1 tbsp of the flour to prevent the mixture from curdling. When all the eggs have been incorporated, gently fold in the rest of the flour and the spices. Finally, fold in the soaked fruit and the orange and lemon zest. Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and smooth the top with the back of the spoon. Bake for 2 hrs or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Your kitchen will be filled with lovely Christmas smells!",
            "Leave the cake to cool in the tin for about 30 mins. Remove from the tin and place on a wire rack until completely cold. If not decorating straight away, wrap the cake in foil to store. If you\u2019ve made your cake a few weeks before you want to eat it, you can brush the cake with a little extra alcohol every week for up to 4 weeks. This will keep it moist and add flavour.",
            "To decorate the cake, brush all over with a little melted jam. Lightly dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll out the marzipan to a circle, large enough to cover the top and sides of the cake. Lift the marzipan by hanging it over the rolling pin and drape it over the cake. Smooth the marzipan down the sides of the cake, then trim away any excess from the bottom. Brush the marzipan all over with the remaining apricot jam, then roll out 1kg of the fondant icing and, using the same method as for the marzipan, cover your cake with the icing. Trim the edges and smooth out any marks with the palm of your hand, rubbing the icing to give it a shine.",
            "Knead the remaining icing, then cut off a small piece, about the size of a small marble, and set aside. Colour the large piece of icing with brown food colouring, adding a little at a time and kneading in well, until you have the desired colour. Divide the icing into 3, then shape a reindeer \u2013 body, head, 2 feet and a tail \u2013 from each piece. Mix 1 tbsp icing sugar with a tiny splash of water to use as a glue. Stick the head onto the body and squash down a little. Use a small knife to make three indents in the feet, then stick to the reindeer body, along with the tail.",

Colour the remaining icing black and shape into two more noses and two eyes for each reindeer, then stick onto the heads. Poke half a pretzel into either side of the reindeers\u2019 heads to create antlers. Use a little of the icing sugar glue to stick the reindeer to the top of the cake, then tie the gold string around their bodies to create reins. Finish the cake by tying a sparkling red ribbon around the base and securing it in place with a pin."

Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a dry frying pan until lightly coloured. Cool slightly, then tip half the almonds and half the pistachios into the food processer and grind to a fine powder. Roughly chop the remaining almonds (keep the pistachios whole).",

            "To test it is cooked through, insert a fine skewer into the centre \u2013 if it comes out clean with no uncooked cake stuck to the skewer, it is cooked. If not, cook for a further 15 mins and test again.",

            "To make the pistachio paste, grind the nuts as finely as possible in a blender or food processor. Tip into a bowl with the sugars and ground almonds. Add a few drops of almond extract, the egg yolks and lemon juice, and mix to a firm dough, using your hands to work the mixture into a ball.",

Dust the work surface with a little icing sugar and roll out the remaining paste to a little larger than the top of the cake. Brush the cake thinly with apricot jam and cover with the paste. Trim off excess using a sharp knife in a downward movement around the side of the cake.",

To make a tree, pinch off a small piece of paste and flatten between your fingers to a rough round. Place on a tray dusted with icing sugar. Make a smaller round and place on top, slightly offcentre. Continue to build up the tree, then top with a tiny paste cone. Repeat to make 7 trees in varying sizes. Leave to dry for several hours or overnight in a cool dry place. To make the icing, beat the egg whites with the lemon juice and glucose in a mixing bowl. Gradually sift in the icing sugar, beating all the time to make a stiff icing that forms peaks.",

Swirl the icing thickly over the cake, forming peaks and teasing it over the sides. Stick the trees into the top of the cake and scatter over a handful of silver balls. Dust the trees thickly with icing sugar."

My husband always does the cooking so this year I offered to do the desserts, this being one of the cakes. It went down an absolute storm, people couldn't get enough of it! I ended up making it twice over the festive period because we all loved it so much. You think it will be really heavy but it isn't at all, and the white chocolate really works with the cake.

Starting from the neck of the turkey, carefully push your fingers underneath the skin until you can get your whole hand between the skin and the breast meat. Trying not to tear the skin as you go, spread the butter inside the pocket, squishing some into the crevice between the thigh and breast meat.",
            "Put the garlic, lemon and bay leaves inside the turkey, then season liberally all over. Put the shallots in your largest flameproof roasting tin and put the turkey on top, breast-side up. Roast for 1 hr, then give it a good baste, pour in the wine and nestle the cabbage wedges in the tin (or underneath the turkey if they won\u2019t fit). Return to the oven for another 30 mins \u2013 covered with foil if the turkey is looking too brown. The juices should run clear when you pierce the thickest part of the thigh, or a thermometer should read 75 C. If not done, carry on cooking for a further 5-10 mins.",
            "Set aside the turkey on a board to rest for 1 hr, transferring the garlic and bay to the roasting tin for the gravy. If you want crispy skin, don\u2019t cover the turkey. Wrap the cabbage wedges in two parcels of foil, with a spoonful of the turkey juices, season liberally and return to the bottom of the oven to carry on cooking while the turkey rests.",
            "Spoon away most of the turkey fat, then put the tin on the hob over a medium heat. Mash the veg with the back of a wooden spoon to extract as much flavour as possible , then pour in the stock and reduce the gravy by half. If you want to thicken it, stir in the cornflour mixed with 1 tbsp water. Once happy with the consistency, strain and keep warm until ready to eat."

Make sure the butter is really soft and handle the pasty to soften the butter as much as possible. I pressed the base into a shallow based try and that meant I could tidy the edges and then I worked a tennis ball size of the pasty in my hands to warm it up and then put it on greaseproof paper, put another piece of greaseproof on top, pushed it down and then rolled it between the paper. Worked perfectly and I cut star shaped tops rather than cover them completely. With my oven, I cooked them for about 17 minutes and they come out perfectly. My other half said they were the best mince pies he\u2019s ever had and his mum is a fantastic baker. Definitely worth making and really quick to make.",

Cover with the parchment again and simmer for 45 mins, turning the mandarin halfway through. By the end of cooking it will be a little translucent and have a dark orange colour. Leave to cool in the syrup (overnight is fine).",
            "To make the pudding, grease a 1.5-litre pudding basin, then scatter over the 2 tbsp sugar. In a large bowl, combine the dry ingredients and a pinch of salt. Coarsely grate the butter, and fold into the fruit with the dry ingredients, followed by the eggs.",

Fold a 3cm pleat in the middle of the sheets, then put over the pudding, buttered baking parchment-side down. Tie with string under the lip of the basin, making a handle as you go. Trim the parchment and foil to about 5cm, then tuck the foil around the parchment to seal.",
            "To cook the pudding, sit it on a heatproof saucer in a very large saucepan, and pour in just-boiled water to come halfway up the side of the basin. Cover and steam for 6 hrs, topping up the water occasionally. Alternatively, place in a slow cooker, pour hot water halfway up the side of the basin and cook on High for 8 1/2 hrs. Leave the pudding to cool, and leave in a cool, dark place to mature. To reheat, steam in a pan for 1 hr or remove the foil and parchment, cover with cling film and microwave on Medium for 10 mins. Cut the pudding with a sharp serrated knife, so that the mandarin stays in place and everyone gets a piece. Serve with cream or brandy butter."

This was my first time to make a gingerbread house, I followed the recipe to the dot (except for not using melasses, but using maple syrup), even bought the brown sugar etc. The ingredients aren't something I have in my house every day, so they were a bit pricey. Let's say that it's UNEATABLE, because of the baking soda it's sour and when you take a bite (I made a few gingerbread men extra), this sour taste stays in your mouth for some time and when you burp (just needed to be honest to the bone), it's horrible! I would say that something must be wrong with this recipe and I'm so disappointed, waisted 3 hours of my life, tons of nervs and money. Horrible!!!",

When you have added enough holly leaves, mix a splash of water into some icing sugar to make a runny but fairly stiff icing, and use this to stick on your glitter berries.

Remove the stars from the freezer and line up in a circle on top of the cake mixture (pointy sides up) \u2013 make sure there are no gaps and that the stars perfectly line up. Spoon the remaining cake mixture on top, easing it around the stars until they are just covered.

Use kitchen scissors to snip the dough ring into 20 strips, from the outside in, but leave a few millimetres of dough still connecting the strips together around the lid in the centre. If using the ready-to-eat pancetta slices, halve each one lengthways. Twist one of the 20 dough strips to make it longer and thinner like a breadstick, then wrap a pancetta slice in a spiral around it. Repeat with all the dough strips.",

Remove the breadsticks from the oven and sit the cheese inside the box lid, then bake for another 5 mins until the bread is golden and crispy, and the cheese molten."

This adds a little bite and some more creaminess.\nBeing designed for the Christmas table, this dish is ENORMOUS! Halving the ingredients will serve 3-4.\nWe love blue cheese in our house, so we add a little extra. If you're not a fan of blue, mature cheddar also works well.\nChestnut puree can be a little tricky to find out of season, but our local Morrisons stock it all year round. A 200g pack of chestnut puree (instead of the 415g tin the recipe suggests) is actually plenty for the full recipe.",

            "When large enough (about 40cm in diameter for a 20cm cake), roll the marzipan onto the rolling pin and lift onto the cake. Smooth the top with your palms and continue down over the sides of the cake, smoothing out any folds as you go. Trim with a knife where the marzipan meets the board, then leave to dry overnight.",
            " Although homemade marzipan contains raw eggs, the amount of sugar, and lack of moisture, prevents bacteria growing when left at room temperature, so your cake should last for 1-2 months iced. The most important thing is that you don't scrimp on drying time \u2013 once you\u2019ve covered your cake in marzipan it should be left to completely dry out for up to 3 days, before you then cover it with icing. If you want to make marzipan before you are ready to cover your cake, then wrap it well in cling film and keep in a fridge for up to a week \u2013 as wrapped in a ball it will still contain a little moisture. As it contains raw eggs it shouldn\u2019t be given to anyone in an at-risk group, including pregnant women, the elderly, the unwell and the very young. You can make a cooked marzipan, which carries no risks. It is a little softer, and harder to work with, but a good substitute if you are at all worried."

Cook for 1 min more until the cheese melts, stirring constantly.",
            "Pour into a bowl and cover the surface with cling film to stop a skin forming. Leave to cool, then chill for 4 hrs or overnight - the mixture needs to be very stiff to form the croquetas. Take heaped teaspoons of the mixture and, with wet hands, roll into 24 small oval shapes and put on a tray. Beat the eggs in a shallow bowl, put the flour on a plate and half of the breadcrumbs in a bowl.",
            "Roll each of the croquetas lightly in flour, then in egg before coating in breadcrumbs. Place on a baking tray lined with baking parchment. Use the remaining breadcrumbs to top up the bowl halfway through the coating process. Chill for 30 mins (or to freeze, see tip, below left).",

Using a metal slotted spoon, lower 6 croquets into the oil and cook for 1.5 mins or until golden brown. Transfer to a baking tray lined with kitchen paper to absorb excess oil, and continue cooking the rest. Serve with the chilli jam for dipping."

Having read the comments (thanks everyone - so helpful!), I replaced the choc brownie with choc muffin as I wanted a lighter trifle. Choc custard was delicious. Nearly made an error with the cherries as I couldn't find the version in the recipe so picked up a couple of cans of tinned cherries, pinched one when I opened the tin - heck a stone! Bit daft, but hadn't been expecting that so quickly stoned them - didn't take long. Another time I might must use frozen stoned cherries which I usually have in the house anyway. Made up for the lack of kirsch by putting in some cherry brandy from the drinks cab. Topping was great, and the whole thing looked rather lovely with lots of grated choc on the top.

            "Butter and line 3 x 15 or 16cm round tins (alternatively do the baking in batches if you only have one tin). Heat the oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3.",
            "Gently melt the chocolate, butter and sugar together in a large microwave-safe bowl on medium heat for a minute at a time, stirring until melted or, set a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Leave to cool a little.",
            "Beat together the eggs with the vanilla and soured cream in a bowl. Sift the flour, cocoa and baking powder into another bowl and whisk to distribute. Stir the egg mix into the cooled melted chocolate, then fold in the flour mix and fold through until all the powder has disappeared.",
            "Spoon a third of the mixture into each tin (if you weigh the tins, you can get it perfectly even and your cakes will cook at the same rate and to the same height). Level off each thin layer with the back of a spoon.",
            "Bake until just\u00a0cooked, so when a skewer poked into the centre of the sponge layer\u00a0comes out with a few crumbs and the cakes are shrinking away from the tin a bit. This will take about 25-30 mins, but check after 20 to be safe as all ovens vary. Remove and cool in the tins on a wire rack, or on top of cold oven hob rings.",
            "Meanwhile, to make the ganache, microwave all the ingredients together in 30 sec bursts until they have all melted, stirring at each\u00a0interval. Or melt everything together in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Cool to room temperature before adding to the buttercream.",
            "To make the buttercream, beat the butter and vanilla paste until pale and creamy.\u00a0Gradually add the icing sugar, beating well between each addition. (Using unrefined sugar will give the buttercream a natural caramel flavour.) Beat in the cooled ganache.",
            "To make the antlers, combine the sugar and butter with the vanilla paste until amalgamated but not creamed. Add the egg and combine. Mix the flour with the spices then tip that in\u00a0and mix to form a dough. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge to firm up for 20 minutes. Roll out on a floured surface to a 5/6mm thickness. Lay the template on the dough and cut around it using a small sharp knife \u2013 make two sets in case of breakages\u00a0(any additional dough can be saved). Push the lolly sticks up into the bottom of the antlers and bake for around 15-20 mins until cooked through and golden. Allow to cool.",
            "Make the ears by pulling a little of the brown fondant icing off the block and kneading it with white fondant icing to make a pale brown. Roll the rest of the dark brown icing out thickly on a surface dusted with icing sugar.\u00a0Roll the paler icing out thinly. Cut large teardrop shapes from the lighter\u00a0icing to form the ears (about 6cm in size) and\u00a0stick the lighter shape on top of the darker icing\u00a0with a little water. Cut a larger teardrop around the lighter shape. Fold and pinch together at the base, push a cocktail stick into the bottom of each one and set\u00a0aside to firm up.",
            "Trim the cakes flat if they have a little hump where they have been baked. Put the first layer\u00a0onto a 16cm cake board and\u00a0use a little of the chocolate frosting to secure it to the board. Spread\u00a0frosting over the first layer then\u00a0add layer two.\u00a0Sandwich together by pressing gently and add another layer of frosting to this layer. For the last layer, take the sponge and invert it on top of the other two cakes, so that the smooth part of the cake \u2013 that was on the bottom of the tin \u2013becomes the top. This will make it nice and neat. Spread a very thin layer of icing over the whole cake to crumb coat it and chill to set for about 30 mins.",
            "Add more buttercream to the cake to make a clean top coat \u2013\u00a0use a palette knife or side scraper to get a smooth finish (but do save a little of the buttercream for the final flourish). Mark out the eyes with a cutter so you can see where to add them. Roll little strips of black fondant icing for the eyes and lashes, then stick these onto the cake. Mould the nose with red fondant icing\u00a0and stick it on with a cocktail stick, pushing one end into the nose and the other into the cake.",
            "For the little collar, roll out about 100g of green fondant icing on a surface dusted with icing sugar and cut a thin strip for the bow that will fit around the base of the cake. Stick\u00a0the ends together with a little water, then\u00a0make a bow by folding another thin strip and stick this onto the collar\u00a0with another dab of water. Scoop the leftover buttercream into a bag with a large star nozzle. Pipe some fluffy reindeer hair on top of the cake, then add the ears and biscuit antlers, pushing them in gently but firmly."

Slowly run your knife down against one side of the ribcage, working down the length of the chicken and keeping close to the bone. As you cut, use the other hand to gently pull away the skin and expose the flesh. Pop out the thigh and wing joints, and cut through where they are attached to the main carcass. Continue cutting down the side of the bird, keeping the knife as close to the carcass as possible, until you reach the ridge of the breast bone, then repeat with the other side.",
            "To remove the carcass completely, snap away the wishbone where it joins at the neck end and carefully cut beneath the breast bone \u2013 this is where the skin is at its thinnest, so carefully cut away, then lift and cut away the carcass, as you don\u2019t want to nip or pierce the skin.",

Remove the 2 smaller fillets that run along the breast and set aside. Finally, use a larger chopping knife to cut off the feet and wing tips, but don\u2019t discard them.",

You should now have the semi-boned chicken, the pheasant breasts, the skinned duck breast and the stuffing. If all that butchery doesn\u2019t appeal, your butcher \u2013 with a bit of warning \u2013 should be able to prepare all the birds to this stage for you.",

Put a third of the stuffing between 2 pieces of cling film and use a rolling pin to roll it out flat so that it just covers the surface area, then place on top of the chicken. Lay the duck breast in the middle of the stuffing, cover with a layer of stuffing, then add the pheasant breasts, skin-side down. Add a final layer of stuffing and lay the 2 chicken mini fillets on top.",

Tuck one edge of it over the other so everything is rolled together and neatly encased, then flip over. Using butcher\u2019s string, tie the chicken at regular intervals around the width, then tie it once around the length to hold the stuffing in. Finally, tie the legs together. Can be prepared to this stage and chilled up to 1 day ahead.",

Place the roast on the vegetables and rub all over with the softened butter. Pour the wine over, then season generously. Put the tin in the oven and cook for 1 hr 40 mins until beautifully browned all over, or until a digital cooking thermometer reads 68C (or above) when inserted in the middle. Remove, loosely cover with foil, and leave to rest somewhere warm for 30 mins.",

Gradually pour in the mushroom soaking liquid, then the chicken stock. Simmer everything together until you have a smooth, thickened gravy, adding any resting juices from the roast. Season to taste, then strain the gravy through a sieve into another saucepan. When the roast has rested, remove the string, carefully carve into thick slices and sprinkle with thyme."

If using a 20cm cake tin, wrap a layer of baking parchment around the outside of the tin, to come up about 5cm above the rim, and secure the paper with string. This will help contain the dough as it rises. Cover lightly with cling film and leave to rise for another hour until it has risen to the top of the tin or paper.",

Mix together the almonds, caster sugar and egg white for the topping and gently brush over the top of the panettone. Place in the oven and bake for 40 - 50 mins until golden and risen and a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle of the cake. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 mins before turning out onto a wire rack. Leave to cool completely before dusting lightly with icing sugar and cutting into wedges to serve."

I saw the winner of the Bake Off Christmas Special do something similar and she baked it for 7 minutes iirc. Also you have to be careful when you whip the double cream because it only takes a few seconds of whipping for it to get too stiff. A warning in the recipe would have been nice for inexperienced bakers like myself.\nThe cream may have benefitted from a little sugar added to it, but I guess that's why they say to add mint to it because something is definitely missing from the cream if you don't add either sugar or mint.\nNext time I will try Delia's recipe as I hear that one is better.",

Warm the milk to hand-hot, then mix into the egg. Pour the milk into the flour mix, then stir with a round-bladed knife to make a soft dough, adding a drop more milk if needed to mop up any dry crumbs in the bottom of the bowl.

Roll out to a final rectangle that is 55cm x 16cm. Roll the marzipan into a sausage shape, so it\u2019s slightly shorter than the length of the dough. Place it down the centre. Roll the dough over the marzipan, then turn the dough over so the join is underneath.

Ten mins before the end of cooking, stir the whole mushrooms around the pan, coating well in the oil and juices, then leave to roast alongside the meat and shallots.

Stir in the soy sauce, season and set aside.",

Take a third of the mixture and gently fold with the sage and roasted squash. For the final layer, boil the kettle, then tip half the spinach into a large colander. Pour over the boiling water to wilt, then repeat with the rest of the spinach. Tip the spinach onto a clean tea towel and squeeze out all the moisture you can. Roughly chop, then mix into the remaining ricotta mixture with the parsley.",

Tip flour and 3 tsp salt into the largest bowl you have and gently melt the butter, shortening and milk with 200ml water in a pan. Once melted, increase heat until bubbling fiercely, tip onto the flour, then quickly beat with a wooden spoon until combined. Don\u2019t worry if some powdery bits remain. Once cool enough to handle, knead until it comes together, then tip onto your work surface.

Spoon in the spinach layer, smooth the surface, then repeat with the barley and finally the squash layer. Dome the squash mix slightly to give a rounded top. Roll out the remaining pastry to fit, brush the edges with some egg, then press the lid over the top. Trim the excess and crimp or pinch to seal, then decorate with pastry trimmings cut into leaves (add bay leaves, if using, when the pie has 30 mins left in the oven). Can be covered and chilled overnight.",

Sit the turkey on a board, very lightly rub all over with olive oil and season with pepper. Lay the pancetta or streaky bacon over the top of the turkey, slightly overlapping to cover it. Tuck the slices under the bird to secure at the bottom. Insert small rosemary sprigs haphazardly between the slices. Season with pepper. Tie the crown across in 2-3 places with butcher\u2019s string, to hold the shape together. Put the onion wedges in the middle of a large roasting tin and sit the crown on top. Cover the turkey with a loose tent of foil, then roast following your calculated time.",

Push the onions to one side of the pan, then add the pine nuts and continue to fry for 1 min more, stirring the nuts until golden. Remove from the heat and cool slightly. Stir in the remaining oil, all but a small handful of the Parmesan and the remaining stuffing ingredients. Season with salt and pepper. Loosely spoon stuffing mixture (don\u2019t pack it down) into an oiled ovenproof dish, drizzle with a little extra olive oil, sprinkle with remaining Parmesan, then lay a sheet of baking parchment on top. Set aside. Can be made 1 day ahead and chilled.",

Remove the foil, place the garlic halves and lemon wedges around the turkey, then baste them and the turkey with the cooking juices. Return the tin to the oven and continue to roast for the final 30 mins. To test if cooked, pierce the fattest part of the crown with a skewer \u2013 the juices should run clear, not pink. If they are pink, continue to roast, checking at 10 min intervals.",

Pour in the stock, bring to the boil, then simmer for 5-10 mins or until reduced to your liking. Season with pepper if needed. Strain the gravy into a pan, warm through, then pour into a jug.

Brush all the borders with half the milk, fold over the ends, then carefully roll the pastry lengthways to completely encase the filling into a roll. Place your six individual Wellingtons on a baking tray lined with baking parchment and chill for at least 1 hr, or cover with cling film and leave overnight. ",

They came out great - I did keep them in my gas oven for 25 minutes. They were floury and light whilst still hot and became more gooey as they cooled. I received a lot of compliments over them and am making them again later this week.",

Leave the turkey in the tin, breast-side up, cover with cling film and put in the fridge for up to 24 hrs. If you don\u2019t have time, or there is no room in the fridge, simply prepare the salt and season the turkey generously before roasting.",
            "To make the bacon butter, gently cook the bacon in a dry frying pan for about 10 mins, stirring occasionally, until the fat has seeped into the pan and is sizzling gently, and the bacon is crisp. Take off the heat and leave to cool slightly. Scrape the bacon and the fat into a food processor with the butter and maple syrup. Blitz to combine, scraping down the sides of the processor from time to time. Roll up the butter in cling film to form a log and place in the fridge. Can be made a few days ahead or frozen for 1 month.",
            "Remove the turkey from the fridge an hour or so before you want to cook it. Remove the bacon butter from the fridge to soften up. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.

            "Gently push your fingers under the skin of the turkey, starting from the neck, until you can push your whole hand in down the length of the breast. Take care not to tear the skin. Use your hands to spread the bacon butter under the skin so that it covers the entire breast area, and there is butter in the crevice between the thigh and the main body. Pop a sprig of thyme under the skin of each breast, then smooth the skin over with your buttery hands. Place the onion, lemon, bay leaves and garlic in the cavity.",
            "Cover the tin loosely with foil and roast for the calculated cooking time \u2013 30 mins before the end of cooking, increase the oven temperature to 200C/180C fan/gas 6, remove the foil, baste the turkey and return to the oven. When the turkey is beautifully brown and cooked through, remove from the oven and leave to rest on a warm platter covered in foil for up to 1 hr.",
            "Pour the fat away from the roasting tin, leaving just the juices. If your tin is flameproof, pour in the Sticky Port gravy (see 'Goes well with', right) to reheat with the juices; if not, tip them both into a saucepan and reheat. Serve the remaining salt mix as a seasoning alongside the rest of the meal."

Beat the butter and sugar together until creamy and pale, then gradually beat in the eggs until light and fluffy. If the mix starts to split or look lumpy, add 1 tbsp of the flour and keep beating.

Glue the ribbon onto the lid/base of your snow globe.",

While the onion cooks, whizz the ginger, garlic, coriander stalks, spices, lemon juice and zest to a paste in the small bowl of a food processor. Tip into the pan and fry for 5 mins more until aromatic. Scoop the paste and onion out of the pan and set aside, then heat 1 tbsp more oil. Add the sliced sprouts and cook for 8-10 mins, stirring, until softened. Add the paste back to the pan and cook everything together for 1 min more.",

Heat the butter and remaining oil in the pan you cooked the rice in, then tip in the rice mixture and flatten the surface. Poke 3 steam holes in the rice with a wooden spoon, and turn the heat to almost its lowest setting. Cover the pan with a tea towel, then a lid, and cook for 20 mins until the rice is cooked through - if it is still a little firm to bite, re-cover and cook for a further 5 mins. To serve, tip the cooked rice onto a serving platter, mixing any crunchy bits from the bottom of the pan. Scatter over the roasted sprouts and coriander leaves, and serve with a pot of natural yogurt."

            "Brush top of the dough liberally with beaten egg and scatter over almonds. Bake for 45-50 mins until the well risen and deep golden brown. Turn out of the tin and cool on a wire rack. Cut into wedges to serve. Will keep for 2 weeks wrapped in foil, or freeze on the day of making for up to 1 month."

Keep checking the tin \u2013 if the vegetables look like they\u2019re burning, add a splash of water or cider. At 30 mins before the end of cooking, remove the foil and season generously.",

Can leave to rest for up to 1 hr. Now make the gravy. Drain the fat and juices from the tin into a jug, discarding the veg and the neck. Place the tin over a flame, then pour in the cider, scraping up the flavour-filled crusty bits with a wooden spoon.

        "Description": "I made this for a Boxing Day buffet and it went down a storm! It does take a bit of time but it's definitely worth the effort. Fed a party of 25 people well as part of a buffet and had the added bonus for us of also happening to be naturally dairy free. I don't have a meat thermometer so I tested whether it was cooked using the spoon method the recipe suggests and it worked perfectly. I also was worried that I couldn't fit all that much stock into the pie but I need not have worried as it came out with lots of jelly. My pie did spring a bit of a leak but I patched that with a bit of spare pastry I had until it was cool, when the jelly had set and it no longer leaked. I also made the cranberry topping which was simple, although I did get lots of juice left. But no matter; seeing as the juice was just a mix of sugar, cranberry and sherry I used it to make Christmas cocktails by mixing it with gin and soda water!",

Can be made up to 2 days in advance.",
            "Lift the cake onto a cake board or plate, then use a pastry brush to cover evenly with a thin layer of jam.

Leave to dry for at least 24 hrs, or up to 3 days, before covering with icing.",
            " Although homemade marzipan contains raw eggs, the amount of sugar, and lack of moisture, prevents bacteria growing when left at room temperature, so your cake should last for 1-2 months iced. The most important thing is that you don't scrimp on drying time \u2013 once you\u2019ve covered your cake in marzipan it should be left to completely dry out, before you then cover it with icing. If you want to make marzipan before you are ready to cover your cake, then wrap it well in cling film and keep in a fridge for up to a week \u2013 as wrapped in a ball it will still contain a little moisture. As it contains raw eggs it shouldn\u2019t be given to anyone in an at-risk group, including pregnant women, the elderly, the unwell and the very young. You can make a cooked marzipan, which carries no risks. It is a little softer, and harder to work with, but a good substitute if you are at all worried."

Defnitely going to make it again and try it hot.\nThe recipe has a lot of steps but I didn't find any of it challenging (it just takes time and lots of washing up!) and I'd call myself a mediocre cook. The pastry was really slimy and strange to work with and I was very pleasantly surprised when it came out crisp and quite tasty. And the filling held its shape perfectly when cut, making it a great centrepiece!",

Once the beets have cooked for 20 mins, add the celeriac and sweet potato to the oven alongside them, and roast all the veg for 40 mins further or until tender. Remove the thyme sprigs, squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins and mash them in with the celeriac, then leave all the veg to cool. All the veg can be cooked the day before and kept in the fridge.",

Mix the coconut oil with 200ml boiling water, stir until melted (put it in the microwave if need\u00a0be), then pour into the flour and mix with a wooden spoon to form a dough. Working as quickly as you can (it\u2019s best to roll the pastry when it\u2019s warm), cut off a \u00bc of the dough and set aside under a tea towel. Roll out the rest to 0.5cm thick, then use it to line the cake tin, pressing the dough into the corners and leaving any excess pastry overhanging the sides. Don\u2019t worry if the pastry breaks \u2013 it\u2019s very forgiving, so you can patch it up as you go. Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6.",

            "Roll out the pastry you set aside to a thickness of 0.5cm to use as the lid. Put the lid on top of the pie and, using a fork, press together the overhanging pastry to create a crimped edge. Make a steam hole, then brush the top with a little almond milk mixed with a spoonful of oil (this will help to colour the pastry). Bake in the centre of the oven for 45 mins until the pastry is a deep golden brown. Leave to cool for 15 mins, then remove from the tin and serve in the middle of the table. Will keep for up to three days in the fridge (the pie is also delicious cold)."

I cooked this for a dinner party for 6, so the portions were generous. Definitely needed a meat thermometer to get right temperature as it needed an extra 10 minutes in the oven.

            "ICE THE CAKE: Melt the apricot jam, then sieve and brush a little all over a 23cm cake (see Apricot & almond fruitcake recipe to the right of this recipe). On a clean surface lightly dusted with a little sifted icing sugar, roll out the marzipan to a circle large enough to cover the cake \u2013 use a piece of kitchen string to help you check. Lift up the marzipan by hanging it over your rolling pin, then drape over the cake. Gently pat and smooth the marzipan down the sides of the cake, then trim any excess from the bottom.",
            "Colour the regal icing with a little blue food colouring, then cover the marzipan using the same method as you covered the cake, firstly brushing the marzipan with more apricot jam. Trim the base.",
            "ADD SOME SNOW: Use your hands to roll two-thirds of the remaining regal icing into a long, thin sausage on an icing sugar-dusted surface. It should be long enough to go round the cake \u2013 use a piece of kitchen string to help you measure it. Use a rolling pin to roll the sausage into a strip about 5cm wide. Use a small, sharp knife to straighten one edge, and trim the other into a wiggly edge.",
            "Keep all the trimmings, and squash half into 2 wobbly circles for the snowmen to sit on. Brush the strip, circles and the very bottom edge of the cake with a little runny icing made with 100g sifted icing sugar and a splash of water. Scatter the desiccated coconut over the strip and circles, gently pressing to stick and cover. Starting with one end of the strip, stick it round the base of the cake. This can be a bit fiddly, so if you\u2019re nervous, simply halve the icing from the start and do in 2 half-length strips, using a little more coconut to hide the joins on the cake.",
            "SHAPE THE SNOWMEN: Roll the remaining third of regal icing into 2 large balls, 2 medium balls and 2 small balls. Stick together, squashing slightly, into 2 snowmen. Brush 4 cocktail sticks with a little brown food colouring and stick into the snowmen for arms.",
            "ADD BUTTONS AND NOSES: Push a few whole cloves into one snowman as buttons. Use a little orange food colouring to dye a little of the strip trimmings, and shape a little around the pointy end of 2 cloves to look like carrot noses. Use another clove to make little holes where the noses will go, dab a bit of runny icing into the holes and stick on the noses, pushing them into the holes to help hold them.",
            "SMILEY FACES: Use a black or brown writing icing pen to dot on smiley mouths and eyes \u2013 I find it helps to mark tiny holes with the end of a cocktail stick first. It stops you making mistakes and helps the icing stay in place.",
            "MAKE THE HAT: Dye another lump of regal icing trimmings with food colouring (we used green). Shape most into a woolly hat shape, pressing a slight dip into the bottom with your thumb where it will sit on the snowman\u2019s head. Roll a little ball to stick on top of the hat; attach it with more runny icing. Then roll and cut a thin strip to stick round the base of the hat. Use a cocktail stick to make markings like a woolly hat and rough up the ball on top. A little more runny icing will help it stick onto your snowman\u2019s head.",
            "AND LASTLY, THE SCARF: Knot the strawberry laces together at one end. Tightly plait a 10cm length and knot at the end again. Using scissors, snip the ends, leaving about 1cm for tassels after the knot, then wrap around the neck of the other snowman. Sit the wobbly snowy islands on top of the cake and a snowman on each one."

Spoon the fat from the juices and discard, then add the juices, onions and stock to the tin. Boil down for about 5 mins until reduced and a little syrupy, stir in redcurrant jelly, then season. Strain into a jug; any resting juices should go in now, too. Lift the turkey onto a platter with the Bacon-wrapped sausages (see recipe below), dotting herb sprigs around to decorate.

Check the pudding is cooked by inserting a skewer into the centre. If the skewer has any uncooked mixture on it, return it to the pan to steam for another 15 mins, then check again. Once cooked, you can cover the pudding with clean baking parchment and foil and keep for up to a week. Re-steam the pudding for 1 hr before serving."

            "First, make the sponges. Using electric beaters or a tabletop mixer, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Pour the eggs in, one at a time, giving the mix a thorough beating before adding the next. If the mix starts to look curdled, add 2 tbsp of the plain flour. Beat in the yogurt.",
            "Mix both the flours together, adding \u00bd tsp salt, and slowly beat into the batter, followed by the malt extract (or vanilla paste) and milk. Spoon half the mixture into one of the 20cm tins, and split the remaining half between the other 20cm tin and the 16cm hemisphere. Bake the smaller amount of cake batter in the 20cm tin and the 16cm tin for 1 hr, and the larger amount for 1 hr 20 mins or until a skewer comes out clean when inserted into the middle of the cakes. Cool in the tin for 10 mins before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely. ",
            "Meanwhile, make the buttercream by beating all the butter and half the icing sugar together using an electric whisk or tabletop mixer. Add the rest of the icing sugar once incorporated, followed by the malt extract (or vanilla paste) and milk. Set aside until ready to use.",
            "To assemble, halve the largest 20cm cake horizontally so you are left with two equal-sized sponges the same size as the remaining 20cm cake. Put a blob of buttercream onto a 23cm cake board (or cake stand) and spread using a palette knife. Stick one of the sponges to the board. Spread a thick layer of buttercream on top of the cake and sandwich another sponge on top. Spread over another thick layer and sit the final sponge on top. Using a palette knife, coat the entire cake in a thin layer of buttercream and smooth the sides and top carefully, working around the whole cake, scraping off any excess icing. Chill in the freezer for 10 mins or in the fridge for 1 hr until set.",
            "Meanwhile, put the hemisphere sponge on the smaller cake board and halve horizontally. Fill the middle with some buttercream, sandwich with the top and coat the entire cake in a thin layer of buttercream. Chill in the freezer for 5 mins or in the fridge for 30 mins.",
            "Take the larger cake out of the fridge/ freezer and coat in another layer of buttercream. Take care when covering this time, as you want a smooth finish to the cake. Running the palette knife under hot water helps smooth over the sides once it is coated completely. Chill again for 5 mins in the freezer.",
            "Cover the hemisphere sponge with buttercream and smooth over with the palette knife. Carefully lift the hemisphere onto the centre of the cake (as the sponge has been frozen you shouldn\u2019t leave finger marks). Press down lightly to set on the buttercream. If there is a gap around the rim, use a small palette knife to fill in with any remaining buttercream. Chill for 10-15 mins.",
            "Meanwhile, make the eyes and nose using coloured fondant. Roll the black fondant into two balls for the eyes, and five smaller balls for the mouth. Roll the orange fondant into a carrot shape. Leave to set and harden slightly while you make the drippy ganache.",
            "Make the drippy ganache by mixing the chocolate and oil and microwaving for 30 secs, stirring and then giving it another 30 secs until melted. Transfer to a squeezy bottle, then pour down the edges of the round cake to create the melting snow effect.",
            "To finish the cake, stick the eyes to the head using a little remaining buttercream. Poke the wooden dowel into the carrot nose, leaving some poking out to stick it to the face. Stick the five small black fondant balls for the mouth and the chocolate buttons down the front of the cake for buttons. Insert the Mikado sticks on either side for the arms. Bring the cake to room temperature before serving."

            "Combine the flour with the baking powder, mixed spice and ground almonds. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until creamy, about 2 mins. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gently fold the flour mixture into the cake mixture in two goes, then fold in the fruits and nuts, followed by the apricots and brandy.",
            "Spoon the mixture into the tin, then smooth the top, making a slight dip in the middle. Bake for 30 mins, then lower the temperature to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2 and bake for another 1 hr 45 mins, laying a sheet of foil loosely over the top for the final 15 mins if it starts to brown too quickly. The cake is done when a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Leave the cake in the tin to cool, then remove the lining paper and wrap well in cling film and foil until ready to decorate (see below or turn the page for another idea).",
            "To create the frosty forest cake: colour the marzipan pale green with a little of the food colouring. Cut off 250g, then make this a shade darker with more food colouring for the trees. To make the trees, roll out the darker green marzipan on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar. Make pointed triangular cardboard tree templates in 3 different sizes (roughly 7.5 x 4cm/6.5 x 3.5cm/5.5 x 3cm). Using these as guides, cut out the tree shapes (see tip, above right). Brush one side lightly with honey, then scatter over silver and coloured dragees, pressing them down lightly to stick. Lay the trees on baking parchment to firm up. This is best done a day or two ahead.",
            "When ready to decorate, sit the cake on a board or plate. On a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, roll the paler green marzipan into a circle wide enough to cover the cake completely. Brush the cake all over with honey. Using a rolling pin, lift and lower the marzipan onto the cake. Smooth the surface of the marzipan with your palms, then trim off any excess from the bottom with a sharp knife.",
            "Cut off two-thirds of the ready-to-roll icing, then roll out a strip about 8cm wide and long enough to go over the top and down the sides of the cake. Cut a wavy line down either side to resemble a path. Brush the marzipan with honey where you want the path to go, then lay the path on top. Trim to neaten the ends.",
            "Take two-thirds of the remaining icing, then roll out 2 long, narrow ropes the same length as the path and about 5mm wide. Dampen the path edges with water and lay the ropes in position. Cut off and roll small pieces from the rest of the icing (and any trimmings), then shape into small snow drifts for the trees to stand in. When the trees are firm, make an indent in the top of each snowdrift with the back of a knife and put each tree into position. Sit the trees on the cake, securing with a little honey underneath. If necessary, cut off some of the rope along the edge of the path to make a flatter surface for the trees. Finally, scatter edible glitter onto the marzipanned cake."

Pour into a bowl and cover the surface of the gravy with cling film or baking parchment to prevent a skin forming as it cools. Chill.",
            "Weigh the turkey (you may need to use bathroom scales) and calculate the cooking time by allowing 40 mins per kg for a 4.5-6.5kg turkey, then 35 mins for every kg of turkey over that weight. As a guide, a turkey this size should take 3 hrs 20 mins-3 hrs 40 mins, plus 30-45 mins resting time.",

Put the onion and lemon, with some bay leaves, inside the cavity. Spread the butter over the skin that covers the breasts and lay the streaky bacon on top, to cover and protect each breast and seal in the butter. Can be done the night before, but take out of the fridge 1 hr before roasting so that it comes back to room temperature.",
            "On the day, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4. Lay the turkey on a large sheet of double-thickness foil, long enough to completely cover it, then lift into a roasting tin and season well. Pour the wine inside the cavity, then bring the foil up over the top of the turkey and seal it well. Roast for the calculated cooking time. For the final 40 mins, open the foil and remove the bacon (serve alongside the turkey or save it for a turkey sandwich). Pour off all of the cooking juices and use a little of the buttery oil that rises to the top to baste the bird. Roast until the turkey is golden and the juices that run out of the thigh are clear, with no sign of pink, when pierced with a skewer. (If you are using a digital thermometer, the thigh should be cooked to 80C and the breast to 75C.) Leave to rest on a warm platter, covered with foil and tea towels, for up to 45 mins.",
            "While the turkey is roasting for the final 40 mins, skim the fat from the pan juices and pour into a jug. The amount of juices you get is dependent on the type of turkey that you are cooking, as speciality bronze turkeys will give you less juice than a white turkey \u2013 so make up to 600ml with chicken stock if you need to. Tip the gravy base into a pan, gently heat it with a little of the turkey juices to loosen the consistency, then gradually blend in the remainder and cook until bubbling. Season.",
            "To serve, carve the turkey in the kitchen and arrange on a hot platter with a little of the hot gravy poured over, or bring the whole bird to the table. Any leftover meat can be frozen in the gravy."

Really easy to make, if the recipe does not make a dough add a tiny bit extra syrup, I did this by mistake as I orginally used 120g like for the other ingredients, realised it was wrong so just added another spoonful and it made a perfect dough. Rolling between the paper is perfect for kids as they dont get flour all over the kitchen. You dont need to leave 2 cm between, they dont spread that much.

Lower the pork into the water, poach gently for 5 mins, then remove it from the water and leave to cool to room temperature.",
            "Meanwhile, toast the fennel seeds and chilli flakes in a dry frying pan over a high heat for 1-2 mins, then tip into a bowl and leave to cool. Grind the spices in a spice grinder or with a pestle and mortar, then mix with 1 tbsp fine sea salt.",
            "Once the pork has cooled, turn it skin-side down and pierce the underside of the meat all over with a knife. Rub the meat with the spiced salt rub, cover and put it in the fridge for at least 8 hrs or overnight. Can be prepared 24 hours ahead.",
            "The next day, make your stuffing. Heat the olive oil in a non-stick frying pan and add the onion and fennel. Season and cook gently over a low heat for 10 mins. Add the coriander seeds and garlic, and cook for another 2 mins, then add the mince. Cook for 8-10 mins until the mince is browned. Set aside and leave to cool.",

Wrap the sides of the belly around the stuffing and tie with butcher\u2019s string. Place seam-side down in a roasting tin, uncovered, and chill for at least 2 hrs, preferably overnight. You want the skin to dry out completely so that it crisps up when you roast it.",
            "To cook the pork, remove it from the fridge and leave it for at least 1 hr to come to room temperature before you cook it. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/ gas 4 and cook the pork for about 2 hrs, turning the tin every 30 mins or so. After 2 hrs, turn the heat up to 220C/ 200C fan/gas 7 and cook for another 20 mins. When the pork is done, a thermometer pushed into its centre should read 77C. If the skin looks in danger of burning, cover it with foil \u2013 but only do this once it has crackled.",
            "Once the pork has cooked, remove from the oven and leave to rest for 30 mins. When you\u2019re ready to carve, put the pork on a big chopping board. Using a sharp knife, slice the meat into rounds."

Only root veg left in the house was sweet potato, so used this instead of celeriac and real potato and also skipped the beans (only baked left in the cupboard, but i reckon they could work). Also used left over gravy to boost the chicken stock. Added in the turkey wrapped bacon. Then I had no Orzo, but I did have thin noodles so added these with the sliced savoy cabbage (instead of kale) at the end.

            "Trim the turkey breast. Its natural shape does not suit the rolled and wrapped Wellington. The thicker neck end can first be trimmed to establish a more cylindrical shape. Trimmings from 2kg/4lb 8oz breasts and upwards, will be enough for the 350g/12oz needed for stuffing. Once trimmed, tie the breast with a 2cm/1in gap between each loop of string, to give a rounded shape.",
            "Heat 2-3 tablespoons of cooking oil in a large frying pan or roasting tray. Season the turkey before pan frying until golden brown all over. Remove from the pan and cool. The breast can now be refrigerated to firm up before removing the string.",
            "Make the stuffing: cook the onions in a knob of butter for a few minutes until softened. Remove from the heat and leave to cool. Roughly chop the turkey trimmings before blitzing in a food processor until smooth. Add sausages and continue to blitz for 30-40 seconds until mixed in. Season and add the eggs. These can be blitzed into the meat for a further minute until the texture thickens.",
            "Spoon the stuffing into a large bowl. Mix in the onions and remaining stuffing ingredients along with extra seasoning, if desired. The stuffing can now be chilled while the bacon and pastry are prepared.",
            "The streaky bacon needs to be rolled thinner. This extends the length of the rashers helping them to wrap around the turkey and stuffing. The easiest method to follow is to lay 3-5 rashers between two sheets of cling film and press with a rolling pin as if rolling pastry. The rashers will easily thin and extend this way. Peel away the top layer of film and remove the rashers and put on a tray. Repeat until all rashers are pressed. Chill until needed.",
            "Roll the puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle approximately 45 x 35cm/18 x 14in. The rashers of bacon can be laid on top of the pastry, leaving a 3-4cm/1\u00bdin border all round. Slightly overlap the rashers as they are laid on the pastry (you'll need about 14-15 rashers).",
            "Spread the cranberry stuffing over the bacon, first mixing it well if it is chilled and set. Keep back a few heaped tablespoons. Remove the string from the turkey and lay the breast lengthwise and presentation side down on top of the stuffing. The reserved stuffing can now be spread along the centre top of the turkey. Lift 4-5 rashers at a time and press them against the breast. Continue until all the rashers on both sides have been lifted and pressed. The remaining rashers can now be laid lengthwise along the top, covering the stuffing that was spread there.",
            "Bring one long side of the pastry up and over the turkey. Brush the other long side with beaten egg, along the 3-4cm/1\u00bdin border, then seal. Brush both ends with beaten egg and fold up to seal in all the ingredients. Turn the Wellington so that the presentation side is up and put on a lightly oiled baking tray, or one covered with greased parchment. Chill.",
            "To cook the Wellington: preheat the oven to 200C/Gas 6/170C in a fan assisted convection oven and bake for 1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 25 minutes maximum. After 45 minutes, brush the Wellington with egg to help colour the pastry. For the most golden of finishes, brush again before the last 15-20 minutes. Once cooked, remove from the oven and rest for 15-20 minutes before lifting carefully on to a carving board with two large fish slices.",
            "While the Wellington is baking the sauce can be made: melt a knob of butter in a pan, once bubbling add the shallots or onions and cook on a medium high heat until a rich deep golden colour. Add the honey and continue to cook for a few minutes until bubbling and almost caramelising. At this point add the red wine vinegar and red wine. Bring to the boil and reduce by half. Add the water or stock and return to simmer. Mix the flour with 25g/1oz butter. Whisk into the sauce a little at a time until completely whisked in. Return the sauce to the boil before reducing to a simmer and cooking for a few minutes. Strain through a sieve and season. Slice the Wellington and serve with Noisette potatoes and buttered Brussels sprouts."

Once melted, take the bowl off the heat and add the rest of the white chocolate and the food colouring, if using (just use a tiny amount as the gel colours are quite strong). Stir occasionally to allow the chocolate to melt in the residual heat. Sprinkle a pinch of meringue into 10 of the holes of your chocolate mould. Once the chocolate has melted, use half to coat the insides of the holes where you have sprinkled meringue. Use the end of a teaspoon to spread the chocolate up the sides of the moulds so that the the inside is coated. Leave to set for 45 mins-1 hr.",
            "Meanwhile, melt the other chocolates in separate bowls using the same method, then use each to coat a further 10 holes of the mould. Keep back half of each chocolate mixture, as you will need this to seal the truffles.",
            "While the chocolate sets, make the fillings. For the Pisco sour filling, beat the softened butter together with the icing sugar until pale and smooth. Add the Pisco, Angostura Bitters and lime zest and stir well. Transfer to a piping bag and store in a cool place until needed.",
            "To make the espresso martini filling, melt the dark chocolate and butter in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water (or in the microwave). Remove from the heat and mix in the double cream, vodka and Kahl\u00faa. Leave to cool for 5 mins. Transfer to a piping bag and store in a cool place until needed.",
            "For the Cosmopolitan filling, Put the dried cranberries in a bowl with the orange liqueur and leave to soak for 15 mins. Beat the butter with the icing sugar, then stir in the cranberries and liqueur, bit by bit. Mix in the lime zest and cranberry jelly. Transfer to a piping bag and store in a cool place until needed.",
            "Once all the chocolate has set in the moulds, pipe the Pisco sour filling into the green/white chocolate shells, the espresso martini filling into the espresso chocolate shells (saving a bit for sticking the beans on later) and the Cosmopolitan filling into the dark chocolate shells. Leave 2mm of space at the top of each one.",
            "Bring the pan(s) of water back to simmering, then set the reserved bowls of chocolate over to melt them again if they have set. Use this remaining chocolate to fill up the moulds and seal in the filling. Try to fill the moulds level or just under \u2013 if they go over, they won\u2019t sit flat when the chocolates are turned out.",
            "Leave your truffles somewhere cool to set completely for at least 2 hrs (ideally overnight). If you put them in the fridge they will set more quickly, but they will lose their shine.",
            "Once set completely, pop the chocolates out of the moulds carefully. Add a brush stroke of gold to the Cosmopolitan truffles using your brush pen. Stick a chocolate- coated coffee bean on each of the espresso martini truffles using a bit of the filling. Arrange in a box lined with baking parchment and tissue paper. Will keep in a cool place for up to 1 week."

But, once on the crackers, with the crips and the scattering of dill...really, really terrific.\nUse a pastry bag or similar if you have to make a lot - it's too fiddly/messy to do properly with a spoon.\nI paired this pass-around hors d'oeuvres with the Feta & Cucumber Bites, also on this site. A great pairing, and everyone thought I was the most fantastic hostess ever ;-)",

Squeeze the sausages from their casings and add to the bowl with the nut mixture. Add the remaining stuffing ingredients, including the reserved lemon zest, and season with salt and pepper.

Remove again, brush the turkey with the glaze, then roast for another 20 mins until golden. If you are roasting potatoes, put them in now. To test if the turkey is cooked, pierce the fattest part of the thigh with a skewer \u2013 the juices should run clear, not pink. If they are pink, continue to roast, checking at 10 min intervals.",
            "Remove the turkey from the oven, transfer to a warm serving platter and rest, covered loosely with foil so it doesn\u2019t stick to the glaze, for up to 1 hr before carving. Meanwhile, cook the stuffing balls and shallots. Increase oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Bake stuffing balls in the oven for 25-30 mins, removing the paper for the last 5 mins if they need browning.",
            "Make the shallots. Put the shallots in a small roasting tin, toss in the oil, scatter over a few thyme and sage sprigs, and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 25-30 mins, turning half way, until shallots are nicely caramelised.",
            "Make the gravy. Pour off any excess fat from the roasting tin but leave the juices and onions. Sprinkle in the flour, set tin over a medium heat and cook, stirring for a couple of mins to cook the flour, scraping up any sticky bits from the bottom of the tin. Gradually pour in the stock, along with any resting juices from the turkey, and continue to stir until slightly thickened. Simmer gently for about 10-15 mins or until reduced to your liking. Season with salt and pepper if needed. Strain gravy into a pan, warm through, pour into a jug and serve with the turkey. Serve the turkey surrounded with stuffing balls, roasted shallots, and thyme and sage sprigs."

Set the tin over a high heat and bring to the boil, then boil rapidly for 8-10 mins until reduced by half.

If it doesn\u2019t cover the duck, top up with the groundnut oil. Cook over the lowest possible heat for 2\u00bd hours, so the fat barely bubbles. The duck skin should be creamy rather than golden once cooked. Transfer the legs to a bowl and strain in the fat, pushing the duck under until fully submerged. (The duck can now be chilled and refrigerated for up to 1 month.)",
            "While the duck is cooking (or up to 2 days ahead of the meal), make the madeira gravy and cabbage. For the gravy, melt the butter in a small pan, add the shallots and cook for 6-8 minutes, stirring until golden. Stir in the flour and cook, stirring all the time, until the flour browns \u2013 take care not to let it burn. Whisk in the stock and continue whisking over the heat until slightly thickened. Add the madeira and cook for 2 minutes more. Strain through a sieve into a bowl. (The gravy can now be cooled and chilled for up to 2 days.)",
            "For the cabbage, scoop 2 tbsp of the goose fat from the duck as it cooks (if making at another time use olive oil) and put into a medium pan. Add the shallots and cook, stirring, until softened. Tip in the juniper berries and cabbage and cook over a fairly high heat until the cabbage starts to soften. Stir in the vinegar, orange juice, raisins and redcurrant jelly. Cover and leave to cook for 15 minutes, stirring now and then until tender. (Cool and chill for up to 2 days if making ahead.)",
            "On the day, preheat the oven to fan 180C/ conventional 200C/gas 6. Remove the duck legs from the fat and wipe away any excess with kitchen paper. Put the duck on a wire rack in a roasting tin and top each leg with a sprig of thyme. Roast for 10 minutes, then add the creamy wild mushroom potatoes to the oven (see recipe, below) and cook with the duck for 30 minutes, or until the duck skin is golden. Meanwhile, reheat the cabbage and gravy in separate pans until piping hot.",

I did change it up a bit though because I was going for more of a fall flavor.\nAdded 3 cinnamon sticks to the spice mix.\nAn extra ball of ginger.\nExtra Star of Anise.\nExtra splash of crema de cassis (just because I love that stuff).\nAnd the biggest change, I did 1 apple instead of 1/4 grapefruit.\nIt created the perfect warm fall beverage. After adding the crema de cassis I poured the entire concoction, spices and all, into my slow cooker on low so it would stay warm for the evening. I just dumped the entire mix in there and after sitting in the wine, the apples made a really delicious treat.",

Remove the top sheet of cling film and sit the fillet down the centre of the mushrooms.

Once the butter has melted, let it cool for a few minutes then gradually mix in the egg yolks. Stir over a low heat for 3-4 minutes until thickened. This stage can also be achieved in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water, stirring continuously for 20-25 minutes until thickened. Once thickened transfer to a clean bowl and leave to cool slightly before covering with cling film or greaseproof paper. Alternatively, store in a sterilised jar.",
            "To make the ice cream: whisk the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and yogurt into the curd and flavour with Grand Marnier. The mix can now be churned in an ice cream maker for 20 minutes before freezing. An alternative method is to freeze the mix for several hours without churning, but you do need to stir it every 20 minutes to break up the crystals until it sets properly. If this second method is followed, remove the ice cream from the freezer about 20-30 minutes before serving to loosen its consistency.",
            "To make the syrup: boil together the tangerine zest and juice with the caster sugar and allow to reduce by a third before adding the Grand Marnier. Mix the arrowroot or cornflour with the orange juice or water and whisk into the simmering syrup. Once returned to a gentle simmer, cook for just 2 minutes before removing from the heat. The candied orange peel, if using, can be added while the syrup is warm. Allow to cool. An alternative method is to reheat the syrup just before serving, adding the peel while the syrup is warming.",
            "To make the meringues: preheat the oven to 120C/Gas \u00bd/fan oven 100C. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks, then gradually whisk in two-thirds of the caster sugar. Continue to whisk to reach stiff peaks. The remaining sugar can now be added. Continue to whisk until the meringue has a good thick creamy consistency. The cornflour and lemon juice can now be whisked in, whisking for another minute.",
            "The meringues can be kept naturally shaped by spooning individual portions on to lightly oiled parchment paper on a baking tray. Or spoon the meringue into a piping bag fitted with a 1cm/\u00bdin plain tube and piping large domes onto the paper. Whichever choice is made, it is important to leave ample space between the meringues to allow them to swell and rise. These can now be baked for 45-50 minutes, about 1 hour maximum. During this time they will take on a light colour, forming a crisp shell that coats the marshmallow centre. The meringues can be cooked at a higher temperature - 150C/Gas 2/fan oven 130C - to give slightly more colour. If so, cooking time will be slightly less, around 40-45 minutes.",
            "When assembling the dish there are two options: if dome-shaped meringues have been made, it is best to crack the tops, placing five or six tangerine segments on top of each if using. The ice cream can now be scooped or scrolled using a warm tablespoon, before sitting on top of the meringue. The syrup with candied fruit can now be drizzled over to finish. The alternative is to simply sit the ice cream and meringue side by side, decorating with segments, if using, and drizzling over the syrup. Whichever you choose, either can be finished with a light dusting of icing sugar, if desired, and perhaps a leaf or sprig of holly."

Note where it's hinged to the carcass and sever between the two joints. Repeat with the other leg. Turn the bird over on to its breast and cut away the backbone where it's attached to the breast. Poultry shears are best for this, but strong scissors or a knife will do. Reveal the wishbone and cut it free, then break away as much of the carcass as you can, leaving the whole two-sided breast (the crown) intact. You will need to sever two more little joints to free the crown entirely and trim off a few flappy, fine ribs from below the breasts, then remove any yellow fat, bits of skin, shot or bloody parts from the crown itself.

Pour away the cooking liquid and discard the aromatics. Use a small, sharp knife to cut and peel away the rind, leaving a thin layer of fat attached to the meat. Line your roasting tin with a few sheets of foil and place the ham in the middle, fat-side up. Use a sharp knife to lightly score the fat in a criss-cross pattern. Return the ham to the oven and bake for 30 mins until the fat starts to crisp and caramelise.",

Drizzle over the 3-4 tbsp of marsala, so each slice gets a little bit, and let it soak in. Tip the drained cherries onto kitchen paper and pat dry (if they are too wet the panettone will go soggy when it thaws), then halve each one to make it easier to cut later.",

Add a little chicken stock and the cavity aromatics to the tin and bring to a boil, then sieve into a pan. Add the rest of the stock, simmer until reduced by half, then stir in 1 tsp grape molasses. Just before serving, add the resting juices from the chicken to the pan and bring the sauce back to the boil. Taste for seasoning and stir in the butter."

To hull the fruit, use a knife to cut a cone shape into the strawberry and remove the stem. Cut any large berries in half.",
            "Put the strawberries in a bowl and gently toss through the sugar. Leave uncovered at room temperature for 12 hrs or overnight. This process helps the sugar to dissolve, ensures the fruit doesn\u2019t disintegrate too much and helps to keep its vibrant colour.",
            "Before starting the jam, put 2 saucers in the freezer. Tip the strawberry mixture into a preserving pan with the lemon juice. Set over a low heat and cook very gently. If any sugar remains on the sides of the pan, dip a pastry brush in hot water and brush the sugar away.",

            "Boil hard for 5-10 mins until the jam has reached 105C on a preserving or digital thermometer, then turn off the heat. If you don\u2019t have a thermometer, spoon a little jam onto one of the cold saucers. Leave for 30 secs, then push with your finger; if the jam wrinkles and doesn\u2019t flood to fill the gap, it is ready. If not, turn the heat back on and boil for 2 mins more, then turn off the heat and do the wrinkle test again. Repeat until ready.",

            "Add a knob of butter, if you like, to the finished jam, and stir in to melt. This will help to dissolve any remaining scum that you haven\u2019t managed to spoon off the top.

To decorate, arrange the cranberries and bay leaves along the length of the log. Dust with a little icing sugar just before serving. Cut into slices, removing cranberries and bay leaves to serve. The roulade can be made up to a day ahead. Take it out of the fridge at least 30 mins before you want to serve it, to allow the filling and icing to soften."

Bake in the oven until the bread is completely dry and browned just a little \u2013 this will take about 20 mins. Remove from the oven and rub with the garlic cloves while still warm. Use a whole clove on each slice, or half if you have small slices. Leave the toasted slices to cool, then put them in a food processor and blitz to rough but not too big breadcrumbs. Empty the crumbs into a mixing bowl and add the dried sage and onion, the parsley and a good pinch of sea salt. Mix together, then set aside in an airtight container. Can be made up to 2 days ahead without the parsley (see tip, below left).",

If you\u2019re not eating the cake within a few hours, store it in the fridge, but bring back to room temperature before serving. Wlll keep for 2 days."

Once the contents sizzle and become well caramelised, pour in the red wine, then boil for a few mins to reduce by about a third. Pour in the chicken stock (or water and stock cube), then simmer for several mins, also allowing it to slightly reduce to strengthen the flavour. Finish off the sauce (which is quite loose) with the knob of butter (for thicker gravy see 'Try' below). Season with salt and pepper and strain through a fine sieve, if you like.",

To do this, remove the duck breasts and legs from the breast bone by cutting either side of the breast bone, following its natural line. Drizzle any excess honey juices over and offer all accompaniments separately."

        "Description": "If you want succulent tasty Turkey this recipe delivers\nWe normally don't have turkey for Christmas - because we found it tasteless and dry -\nTried this this year and brined the turkey for 8 hours on 24th Dec - stuffed the crown as suggested and left overnight - so Christmas morning all we had to do was put it in the oven.\nYes the mushroom stuffing makes the Turkey look dark, however was very tasty\nTurkey was held in a \"Hostess trolley\" for 2 hours ( late family arrivals) and still remained succulent and tasty.\nOnly thing slightly negative was the skin was not crispy - otherwise highly recommend this recipe",

Cook for 10 mins more until all the liquid has evaporated. Drizzle with the truffle oil and leave to cool, then mix together with the remaining butter.",
            "Remove the turkey from the brine and discard the liquid. Use kitchen paper to gently pat the meat until it\u2019s dry all over, then use your fingers or a spoon to gently ease under the skin of the bird, making a pocket between its flesh and skin. Smear the truffle butter all over the flesh, following the contours of the breast. Brush a little more butter over the skin, then place in a roasting tin. Can chill at this stage up to 1 day ahead.",
            "Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Roast for 1 hr (about 40 mins per kg). Halfway through cooking, baste with the juices and loosely cover with foil if the skin is browning. Check that the turkey is done by piercing the thickest part with a skewer \u2013 the juices should run clear. Remove from the tin and leave to rest, covered loosely with foil, for 10 mins.",
            "While the turkey is resting, make the gravy. Pour away any excess fat from the roasting tin, then place the tin over a medium heat on the hob. Tip in the shallot, then cook for a couple of mins, stirring often. When the shallot has softened, sprinkle over the flour and mix through. Slowly pour in the madeira, scraping up any caramelised cooking juices. If the gravy starts to turn lumpy, quickly whisk out any lumps. Bring to the boil and simmer until reduced by half, then pour in the chicken stock. Simmer for 5-10 mins until lightly thickened. Strain before serving, if you like."

Before serving, drizzle over 1 tsp of the reserved passion fruit seeds over the top of the cake.

The dough should be approximately 5mm thick. Using a star cutter (about 6cm wide) dipped in a little flour to stop it from sticking, cut out as many star shapes as you can. Then lightly knead the dough trimmings together and roll out again. Keep going until you have about 24 stars. Carefully place the stars on a baking sheet, making sure you keep them slightly apart.",

Place a blob of jam onto the centre of the biscuits without the cut-out circle. Be generous \u2013 you want the jam to show at the edges as well as the centre. Place the top halves of the biscuits on and push down gently. These will keep in an airtight container for up to 3 days."

Add the onion to the pan and continue cooking until softened and starting to caramelise. Add the thyme, stock cube, porcini and some seasoning. Pour 450ml water into the pan, stirring to scrape any meaty bits off the bottom. Cover with a lid and place in the oven to cook for 3 hrs, turning the meat over in the liquid once while cooking, and topping up with a splash of water if the pan looks dry.",

Fold the prosciutto over the meat to encase it, then flip the little parcel of meat over, so the smooth side is facing up on top of the pastry.

Fill the can one-third full with baking beans, rice or dried pulses (to weigh it down), then position in the middle of the tin. Spoon the cake mix around the \u2018ring\u2019, then smooth the top. Bake at 160C/fan 140C/gas 3 for 1\u00bd hrs, then turn down to 140C/fan 120C/gas 1 and bake for another hour or until a skewer comes out clean.",

Dissolve the sugar in the tea, add the whisky or orange juice, then spoon over the surface. If you\u2019re making the cake ahead of time, feed it with a fresh swig of hot toddy every week, but take care not to make the cake soggy. Can be kept for a month well-wrapped in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. If short on time, the cake can be made the same day that you decorate it.",

Dip the tips of the leaves into the egg white, shake off any excess, then dip into the sugar to coat. Leave to dry while you cover the cake with marzipan. If your cranberries are frozen, leave them on a few sheets of kitchen towel at this stage to thaw and dry out, or the juice will run into the icing.",

Alternatively, roll the marzipan a little larger than you need, then cut a round using the cake tin\u2019s base as a guide. Turn the marzipan over. Brush the top of the cake with jam, then put it, jam side down, on the marzipan.",

Spread over the marzipan with a palette knife, then decorate the top with cranberries, bay leaves and the frosted eucalyptus sprigs. Leave to set overnight before cutting.

I do have a couple of tips from making these today- reduce the almond extract by a touch, maybe closer to 3/4 of a teaspoon. Also, when you spread the cookies out, do them thin- thinner than feels comfortable, and reduce the bake by a few minutes, closer to 8/9 minutes. This gives you a lovely \u2018snap\u2019. You definitely need to have asbestos hands to shape these too! I\u2019d recommend wearing some kind of thin glove if you can. However, these were surprisingly easy and the flavour was almost identical to that of an authentic Fortune Cookie! Very impressed, thank you for the recipe!",

I also left out the sweets for decoration and replaced it with raspberries; you'll need lots of tart berries to balance the mountains of butter cream.\nIt turned out a very heavy cake.

Slash through skin where the thigh joins the body and pull leg firmly from socket to dislocate the thigh bone. Press down and pull to expose the 'oyster' muscle underneath the bird. Slice the thigh away from the back of the body.",

Tip the bacon into the pan along with the chicken, stirring until lightly browned and crisp. Using tongs, remove the chicken to a plate.",
            "Add all the vegetables and herbs to the bacon with a splash more oil, if necessary, then cook for about 5 mins, stirring once or twice. Pour in the Cognac and bubble up, scraping the pan to deglaze, for 2-3 mins. Then pour in all the wine and bring to the boil.",
            "Tip in the chicken joints; press into the pan so they are immersed in liquid and cook, uncovered, for 10 mins, until the wine has reduced by half. Pour in the stock, return to a simmer, season and cook, uncovered, for 1 hr until the liquid has reduced by half and the chicken is tender. Set aside for 10 mins before serving.",

Now pour over the chilli clarified butter to give a thin covering. Stir the butter to distribute the spice each time before you pour. If the butter cools too much, microwave it for 30 seconds. Cover the ramekins and put in the fridge for 2 hours, or overnight, until the butter is set.",
            "Make the melba toast: lightly toast the bread. Cut off the crusts, then slice the bread through the centre so you have ultra thin slices. Put the toast, cut-side up, under a medium to hot grill to toast until the edges curl. Be careful as it burns easily. Cool, and store in sealed plastic bags.",
            " Remove the potted crab from the fridge an hour before serving, but keep in a cool place. You want the mixture to be soft enough so that all the delicious buttery flavours blend into the toast. Put each ramekin or a spoonful of spicy crab on to a serving plate with a lemon wedge.",
            "Crisp the melba toast, if necessary, in the oven for 5 minutes. Place a couple of slices on each plate and serve."

            "Preheat the oven to 230C/Gas 8/fan oven 210C. Brown the duck bits in the oven for about 30 minutes. Transfer to a stockpot. Discard the fat and place the tin over a medium-high flame. Pour in the Marsala and 200ml/7fl oz cold water, bring to the boil and scrape any stuck-on bits into the liquid. Boil for 2 minutes then scrape everything into the stockpot.",
            "Add 2.25 litres/4 pints cold water to the pot and bring to the boil over a medium heat, uncovered. Scoop off any scum, then add the vegetables and herbs. Bring back to the boil, de-scum again.",
            "Now very gently simmer for 2 hours, adding cold water if the liquid falls below the level of the bones. Remove from the heat and drain through muslin-lined colander (or use a clean tea towel) into a heatproof bowl. Cool, then refrigerate until jellied.",
            "Heat the butter and oil in a large, nonstick frying pan over a low-medium heat, then tip in the onions. Cook for about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until meltingly soft. Turn heat to high, add the Marsala and boil for 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until onions are syrupy. Set aside.",
            "Meanwhile, remove the solidified fat from the stock and discard. Boil the stock in a saucepan, uncovered, until reduced to 500ml/18fl oz. Add the white wine and boil for 10 minutes, uncovered. Add the onions and sage and bring back to the boil. (Prepare in advance up to this point.)",
            "To finish the sauce, pour in the cream and boil furiously for 4-5 minutes, season to taste. Serve in a warmed jug."
